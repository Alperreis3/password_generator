# PyPassword Generator
This code is a password generator that allows the user to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers to include in the generated password. The password is generated by selecting random elements from predefined lists of letters, symbols, and numbers and combining them into a single list. The list is then shuffled to create a more secure password.

# Getting Started
To run this code, you will need a Python interpreter. No additional dependencies are required.

# Usage
To generate a password, run the code and follow the prompts. You will be asked to specify the number of letters, symbols, and numbers to include in the password. The password will then be generated and printed to the screen.

# Known Issues
The code does not currently handle input validation, so entering negative numbers or non-integer values may cause the code to crash.

Future Development
* Implement input validation to handle invalid user input.
* Add the option for the user to specify the specific letters, symbols, and numbers to include in the password.
* Implement a system for saving and managing multiple generated passwords.
